  ## Why This Project Matters

Modern enterprises deal with complex data systems spread across multiple sources.
Traditional database interactions require technical expertise and rigid query writing.

This project demonstrates a modular multi-agent architecture that simulates intelligent query planning, 
schema understanding, and orchestrated execution.
It represents how future AI-driven database systems can autonomously interpret user intent 
and manage structured data workflows efficiently.
